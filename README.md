### Problem Statement : Investment Journey Gamification

##### This branch is created by Radha Gupta 


##### My Plan for solution:
1. I am building a backend application which will take user's age, salary and time period to invest and the backend application will return the amount that the user should invest according to the request.
2. Backend Application will return various investment options to the user 
    - Best Case
    - Average Case
    - Worst Case
3. This data will vary as per the age of the user
    - If a user is young in his 20's he can invest more 
    - This investment will decrease as he moves in 30's and 40's
    - And finally it will be constant at some stage to 65 age
4. Once we achieve this we can target for more fearures like:
    - How much percentage of their salary user should keep in their Fixed deposit
    - How much they should invest in Stocks
    - The above data will also be dependent on Age and provided according to financial articles like Investopedia.com
